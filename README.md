# 🔐 OAuth2 Client Credentials Grant in Java

This project demonstrates how to implement secure machine-to-machine authentication in **Java** using the **OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant** flow. It's designed for backend systems and services that need to authenticate themselves with an authorization server in order to access protected resources — without user interaction.

## 📌 Features

- Implements the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant flow
- Retrieves and uses access tokens securely
- Makes authorized API requests
- Handles token expiration
- Clean, modular Java code

## 🚀 Use Cases

- Microservices communication
- Server-to-server API access
- Background jobs or scheduled tasks
- Internal backend tools

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- Language: Java
- HTTP Client: [e.g., Apache HttpClient, OkHttp, Java 11+ HttpClient]
- OAuth2 Provider: [e.g., Keycloak, Auth0, Azure AD]
- Build Tool: [e.g., Maven or Gradle]

## 🔧 How It Works

1. The client authenticates with the authorization server using its **client ID** and **client secret**.
2. An **access token** is returned from the token endpoint.
3. The client uses this token to make authorized requests to a protected resource.

## 📄 Example Flow

```http
POST /oauth/token
Host: auth.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=client_credentials&
client_id=your_client_id&
client_secret=your_client_secret
